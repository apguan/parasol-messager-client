Download expo

NOTE: by default Expo uses Yarn. Go install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) if you don't have it

```
npm install --global expo-cli 

# check it 
expo whoami

# if you don't have an expo account
expo register

# If you already have an Expo account
expo login
```

Cool, now that you're set up with Expo, just run 

```
#install deps
expo install 
```

Finally, start up iphone simulator or android studio and run the respective script: 
```
expo run --ios 

OR 

expo run --android
```
